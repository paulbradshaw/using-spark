  <p>Here are numbers: <span class="sparkline">123{30,60,90}456</span>. At the moment they just look like numbers, because the font to turn it into a sparkline chart isn't stored on the same server. But you can adapt this page to make it work by exporting it, and then <a href="https://github.com/paulbradshaw/spark/blob/master/Output/Webfonts/Bar%20-%20medium/spark-bar-medium.woff">downloading the font from here</a> and putting it in the same folder as this webpage.</p>
<p class="other">This is another line.</p>
