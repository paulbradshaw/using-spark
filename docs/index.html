  <h1>Examples of using the Spark font for creating charts in text</h1>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="barchart">2010 {4,0,0,0,6,29,70} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
  <p>That chart above is created using the font Spark: each bar of the chart is actually a number.</p>
  <p> The font to turn it into a chart needs to be stored in the same place as the CSS file.</p>
  <h2>Using other chart fonts</h2>
  <p> Here's the same sentence again but using a different font (and class attribute) to create a different chart. Notice that it doesn't work properly because the numbers aren't kept within the range 0-9 (the numbers are {4,0,0,0,6,29,70})</p>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="linechart">2010 {4,0,0,0,6,29,70} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
  <p> Here it is again but with the numbers changed to {1,0,0,0,1,3,7}:</p>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="linechart">2010 {1,0,0,0,1,3,7} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
  <h2>And the rest</h2>
  <p>Now for the medium dot chart. This one uses the same 0-100 range as the bar chart, so the original figures {4,0,0,0,6,29,70} work fine:</p>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="dotchart">2010 {4,0,0,0,6,29,70} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
  <p>With the numbers changed to {1,0,0,0,1,3,7} the difference is too small to be meaningful:</p>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="dotchart">2010 {1,0,0,0,1,3,7} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
  <p>Now for the small dot chart:</p>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="dotchartsmall">2010 {4,0,0,0,6,29,70} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
  <p>Then the narrow bar chart:</p>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="barchartnarrow">2010 {4,0,0,0,6,29,70} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
  <p>And the thin bar chart:</p>
  <p>There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - compared to 29 in 2015 and just 6 in 2014. There were no incidents at all between 2011 and 2013: <span class="barchartthin">2010 {4,0,0,0,6,29,70} 2016</span>. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. </p>
